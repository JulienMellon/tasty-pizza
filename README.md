## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A pretty pizza shop website built using a template.

## Optimizations

A real pizza website would have functionality to place an order and all sorts of little widgets that link to a google map and socials.


## Lessons Learned:

I'm not a designer.  Just because I know how to make the HTML and CSS do things doesn't mean that it's the best use of my time to try and make somthing like this from scratch.
